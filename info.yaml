  description: |
    This project implements a Binarized Neural Network (BNN) on silicon to classify microgreen growth stages. It uses XNOR-popcount operations for efficient inference.

  how_it_works: |
    - Input: 4 features (height, color, width, stem thickness)
    - Hidden layer: 4 neurons
    - Output: 3 classes (germination, growth, harvest-ready)
    - Uses pre-trained weights included in the design.

  how_to_test: |
    Provide 4-bit inputs for height, color, width, and stem. The design outputs a 3-bit classification and a ready signal.
