  description: |
    A dedicated Neural Network (BNN) accelerator for precision farming.
    It takes 4 sensor inputs (Height, Greenness, Density, Texture) and 
    classifies the plant state as either 'Growth Phase' or 'Harvest Ready'.
  language: "Verilog"
  clock_hz: 0 # Clock frequency (0 for combinatorial designs)

documentation:
  how_it_works: |
    The system uses a pre-trained Binarized Neural Network (BNN).
    The weights are trained in Python and baked into the Verilog hardware.
    The inputs are weighted, summed, and passed through a step activation function.
    The final output compares the accumulated scores for 'Growth' vs 'Harvest'
    and lights up the corresponding LED.

  how_to_test: |
    1. Set inputs ui[0] to ui[3] (Feature inputs).
    2. Reset the chip (rst_n low then high).
    3. Observe outputs uo[0] (Growth LED) and uo[1] (Harvest LED).
    4. Example: Set all inputs high -> Harvest LED should turn on.
